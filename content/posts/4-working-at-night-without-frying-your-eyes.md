first PC

adopted the [maker's shedule](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html),
not because I was actually making anything at that time, simply
because I liked the quietness of the night on the campus.

From this time I kept the habit of being a night owl. Even during my early years 
after graduation I kept spending a lot of time researching and working at night.
I remember how after a certain amount of time behind my screen
the feelling of tiredness vanished, finding myself shutting down my laptop at 3 am
while having a corporate job beginning at 9. I remember how hurting it was on my eyes.
Even a low screen brightness was uncomfortable.

I was truly sleep depraved. And this is part of the reasons why I decided to bend
the path of my carrer.

Today as a programmer I still spend a lot of my working time behind a screen.
Almost half of this time between sunset and sunrise. The lack of interuptions
allows me to achieve things I am not able to do when everyone is buzzing around.

I adopted a wonderfull tool 2 years ago : a filter that decreases the color's
temperature of my screen after sunset. The software I use is called [redshift](http://jonls.dk/redshift/),
which is the open source version of [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/).

I also use [Twilight](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.lux)
on my phone to remove any source of "blue light" in my environment.


last source of intensive light, LED indicators
tapped them with a bit of electric tape.

If it happens that you too work in a dark environment. I highly suggest you to
try one of these color filters and share your experience with me.

how your screen's color affects your sleep patterns.
